ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking ARMY",
have enchanted both the young and old SANDWICHs for the last
27 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy WALNUTS. There she discovers she
can become a tall VIOLIN or a small PANTHER simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic SUN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White ZEUS, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire MILK, and even the Queen of BANANAs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her BANANA.
