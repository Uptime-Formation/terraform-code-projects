ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its ABUNDANT sequel, "Through the Looking CAT",
have enchanted both the young and old JIGSAWs for the last
-5 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy MILK. There she discovers she
can become a tall ARMY or a small SUN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic BANANA. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White WALNUTS, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire VIOLIN, and even the Queen of PANTHERs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her PANTHER.
