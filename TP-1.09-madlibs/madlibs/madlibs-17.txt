HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many GRUMPY photographers make big money
photographing SANDWICHs and beautiful JIGSAWs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in PANTHER advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a BANANA camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
CAT. Then you either hire professional JIGSAWs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SUNs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 42 years.
