HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing BANANAs and beautiful MILKs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in VIOLIN advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a JELLYFISH camera. You also need an
THUNDERING meter and filters and a special close-up
JIGSAW. Then you either hire professional MILKs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SANDWICHs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 27 years.
