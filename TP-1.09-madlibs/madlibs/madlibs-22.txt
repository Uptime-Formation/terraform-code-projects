THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a BANANA, and it looked like a giant
CAT with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a MILK and were able to see ARMYs in
the sky that were millions of JELLYFISHs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
PANTHERs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting JIGSAWs. An eclipse occurs when a SANDWICH
comes between the earth and the SUN and everything
gets ABUNDANT. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern ZEUS.
