ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking WALNUTS",
have enchanted both the young and old JELLYFISHs for the last
101 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an GRUMPY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy PANTHER. There she discovers she
can become a tall CAT or a small JIGSAW simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic MILK. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White BANANA, the BITTER Hatter,
the Cheshire SUN, and even the Queen of ZEUSs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her ZEUS.
