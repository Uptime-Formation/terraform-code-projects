HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing SANDWICHs and beautiful PANTHERs. They sell
the prints to STICKY magazines or to agencies who use
them in JIGSAW advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a CAT camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
SUN. Then you either hire professional PANTHERs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary VIOLINs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least 42 years.
