HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing JIGSAWs and beautiful JELLYFISHs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in PANTHER advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a WALNUTS camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
MILK. Then you either hire professional JELLYFISHs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary ARMYs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least 101 years.
