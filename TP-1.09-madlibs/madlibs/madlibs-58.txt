THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a SUN, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its JELLYFISH. We went inside and
looked through a ARMY and were able to see SANDWICHs in
the sky that were millions of MILKs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
WALNUTSs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting BANANAs. An eclipse occurs when a VIOLIN
comes between the earth and the ZEUS and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern PANTHER.
