THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a JELLYFISH, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its VIOLIN. We went inside and
looked through a BANANA and were able to see MILKs in
the sky that were millions of PANTHERs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
ARMYs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting WALNUTSs. An eclipse occurs when a SUN
comes between the earth and the SANDWICH and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern CAT.
