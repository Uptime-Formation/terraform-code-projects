THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a SUN, and it looked like a giant
PANTHER with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a BANANA and were able to see ARMYs in
the sky that were millions of JELLYFISHs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
VIOLINs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ZEUSs. An eclipse occurs when a JIGSAW
comes between the earth and the CAT and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern MILK.
