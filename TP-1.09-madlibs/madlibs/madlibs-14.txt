HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing BANANAs and beautiful WALNUTSs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in JIGSAW advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a JELLYFISH camera. You also need an
ABUNDANT meter and filters and a special close-up
CAT. Then you either hire professional WALNUTSs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary VIOLINs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 101 years.
