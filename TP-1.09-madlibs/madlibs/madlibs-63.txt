ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking ARMY",
have enchanted both the young and old VIOLINs for the last
42 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she LOVEs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy JELLYFISH. There she discovers she
can become a tall PANTHER or a small ZEUS simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic BANANA. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White SANDWICH, the STICKY Hatter,
the Cheshire WALNUTS, and even the Queen of CATs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an GRUMPY
end when Alice awakens from her CAT.
