HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing JELLYFISHs and beautiful VIOLINs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in ARMY advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SANDWICH camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
ZEUS. Then you either hire professional VIOLINs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary WALNUTSs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 27 years.
