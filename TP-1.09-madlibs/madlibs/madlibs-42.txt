ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its STICKY sequel, "Through the Looking SANDWICH",
have enchanted both the young and old JELLYFISHs for the last
101 years, Alice's GRUMPY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy VIOLIN. There she discovers she
can become a tall CAT or a small PANTHER simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic BANANA. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White MILK, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire JIGSAW, and even the Queen of SUNs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an CHUBBY
end when Alice awakens from her SUN.
