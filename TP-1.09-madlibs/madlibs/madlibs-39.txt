ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its BITTER sequel, "Through the Looking ZEUS",
have enchanted both the young and old JELLYFISHs for the last
-5 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy SANDWICH. There she discovers she
can become a tall JIGSAW or a small PANTHER simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic BANANA. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice DANCEs such remarkable
characters as the White SUN, the CHUBBY Hatter,
the Cheshire ARMY, and even the Queen of WALNUTSs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an THUNDERING
end when Alice awakens from her WALNUTS.
