ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking SUN",
have enchanted both the young and old PANTHERs for the last
42 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an GRUMPY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy VIOLIN. There she discovers she
can become a tall ZEUS or a small SANDWICH simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic MILK. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White CAT, the ABUNDANT Hatter,
the Cheshire BANANA, and even the Queen of JELLYFISHs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her JELLYFISH.
