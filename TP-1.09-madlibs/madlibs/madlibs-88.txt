THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a VIOLIN, and it looked like a giant
ZEUS with a slit down its SUN. We went inside and
looked through a JELLYFISH and were able to see WALNUTSs in
the sky that were millions of SANDWICHs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
MILKs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting CATs. An eclipse occurs when a JIGSAW
comes between the earth and the PANTHER and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern ARMY.
