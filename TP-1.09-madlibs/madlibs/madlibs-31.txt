THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a CAT, and it looked like a giant
ARMY with a slit down its SANDWICH. We went inside and
looked through a JIGSAW and were able to see BANANAs in
the sky that were millions of ZEUSs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
PANTHERs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting JELLYFISHs. An eclipse occurs when a MILK
comes between the earth and the SUN and everything
gets BITTER. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern VIOLIN.
