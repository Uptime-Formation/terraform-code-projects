HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many GRUMPY photographers make big money
photographing VIOLINs and beautiful SANDWICHs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in CAT advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a JIGSAW camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
WALNUTS. Then you either hire professional SANDWICHs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary PANTHERs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very WEARILY for at
least 0 years.
