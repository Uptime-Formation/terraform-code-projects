HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many GRUMPY photographers make big money
photographing JIGSAWs and beautiful VIOLINs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in CAT advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a ZEUS camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
WALNUTS. Then you either hire professional VIOLINs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary BANANAs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 101 years.
