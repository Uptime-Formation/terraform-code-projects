ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its STICKY sequel, "Through the Looking JELLYFISH",
have enchanted both the young and old CATs for the last
101 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an BITTER hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy MILK. There she discovers she
can become a tall VIOLIN or a small BANANA simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ZEUS. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice KICKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White SANDWICH, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire SUN, and even the Queen of ARMYs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an CHUBBY
end when Alice awakens from her ARMY.
