THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a JIGSAW, and it looked like a giant
ZEUS with a slit down its MILK. We went inside and
looked through a JELLYFISH and were able to see SANDWICHs in
the sky that were millions of PANTHERs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
WALNUTSs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ARMYs. An eclipse occurs when a BANANA
comes between the earth and the SUN and everything
gets CHUBBY. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern CAT.
