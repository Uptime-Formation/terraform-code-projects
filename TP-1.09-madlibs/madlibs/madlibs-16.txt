THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a SUN, and it looked like a giant
SANDWICH with a slit down its JIGSAW. We went inside and
looked through a ZEUS and were able to see ARMYs in
the sky that were millions of WALNUTSs away. The men and
women who RUN in the observatory are called
BANANAs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting VIOLINs. An eclipse occurs when a MILK
comes between the earth and the CAT and everything
gets CHUBBY. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern JELLYFISH.
