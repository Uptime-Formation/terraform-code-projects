ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking WALNUTS",
have enchanted both the young and old ARMYs for the last
42 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she RUNs down a/an THUNDERING hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy SUN. There she discovers she
can become a tall JELLYFISH or a small PANTHER simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic CAT. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White MILK, the BITTER Hatter,
the Cheshire VIOLIN, and even the Queen of SANDWICHs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her SANDWICH.
