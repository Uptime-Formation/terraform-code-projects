ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its STICKY sequel, "Through the Looking CAT",
have enchanted both the young and old PANTHERs for the last
27 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an THUNDERING hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy ZEUS. There she discovers she
can become a tall MILK or a small BANANA simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic WALNUTS. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice DANCEs such remarkable
characters as the White VIOLIN, the ABUNDANT Hatter,
the Cheshire JELLYFISH, and even the Queen of JIGSAWs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an GRUMPY
end when Alice awakens from her JIGSAW.
