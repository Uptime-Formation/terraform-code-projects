ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking ARMY",
have enchanted both the young and old PANTHERs for the last
0 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an GRUMPY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy WALNUTS. There she discovers she
can become a tall ZEUS or a small VIOLIN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic SUN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice KICKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White SANDWICH, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire JELLYFISH, and even the Queen of MILKs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her MILK.
