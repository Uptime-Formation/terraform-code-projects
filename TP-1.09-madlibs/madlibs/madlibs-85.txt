THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a SUN, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its CAT. We went inside and
looked through a MILK and were able to see JELLYFISHs in
the sky that were millions of PANTHERs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
ARMYs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting SANDWICHs. An eclipse occurs when a ZEUS
comes between the earth and the WALNUTS and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern VIOLIN.
