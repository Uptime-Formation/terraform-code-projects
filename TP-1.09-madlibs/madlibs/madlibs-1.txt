THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a VIOLIN, and it looked like a giant
CAT with a slit down its BANANA. We went inside and
looked through a JIGSAW and were able to see MILKs in
the sky that were millions of JELLYFISHs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
SANDWICHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ARMYs. An eclipse occurs when a ZEUS
comes between the earth and the SUN and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern PANTHER.
