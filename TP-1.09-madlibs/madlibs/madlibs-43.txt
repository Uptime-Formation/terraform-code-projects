THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a JELLYFISH, and it looked like a giant
ZEUS with a slit down its SUN. We went inside and
looked through a PANTHER and were able to see WALNUTSs in
the sky that were millions of ARMYs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
MILKs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting JIGSAWs. An eclipse occurs when a BANANA
comes between the earth and the CAT and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern SANDWICH.
