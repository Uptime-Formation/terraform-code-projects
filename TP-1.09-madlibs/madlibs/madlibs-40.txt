THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a SUN, and it looked like a giant
PANTHER with a slit down its BANANA. We went inside and
looked through a ZEUS and were able to see SANDWICHs in
the sky that were millions of ARMYs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
VIOLINs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting JIGSAWs. An eclipse occurs when a CAT
comes between the earth and the MILK and everything
gets BITTER. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern WALNUTS.
