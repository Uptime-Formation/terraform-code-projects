THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a VIOLIN, and it looked like a giant
SUN with a slit down its MILK. We went inside and
looked through a CAT and were able to see WALNUTSs in
the sky that were millions of ZEUSs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
BANANAs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ARMYs. An eclipse occurs when a JIGSAW
comes between the earth and the PANTHER and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern SANDWICH.
