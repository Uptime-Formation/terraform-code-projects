ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its ABUNDANT sequel, "Through the Looking VIOLIN",
have enchanted both the young and old CATs for the last
27 years, Alice's BITTER adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an THUNDERING hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy WALNUTS. There she discovers she
can become a tall PANTHER or a small BANANA simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ARMY. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White SUN, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire SANDWICH, and even the Queen of JIGSAWs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an CHUBBY
end when Alice awakens from her JIGSAW.
