HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing JIGSAWs and beautiful ARMYs. They sell
the prints to BITTER magazines or to agencies who use
them in CAT advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a WALNUTS camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
SANDWICH. Then you either hire professional ARMYs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary BANANAs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least 73 years.
