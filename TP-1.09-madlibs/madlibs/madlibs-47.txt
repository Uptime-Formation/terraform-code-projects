HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing WALNUTSs and beautiful BANANAs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in VIOLIN advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a JELLYFISH camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
SANDWICH. Then you either hire professional BANANAs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SUNs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 73 years.
