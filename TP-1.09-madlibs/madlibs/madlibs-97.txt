THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a VIOLIN, and it looked like a giant
MILK with a slit down its JIGSAW. We went inside and
looked through a JELLYFISH and were able to see ZEUSs in
the sky that were millions of CATs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
PANTHERs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting WALNUTSs. An eclipse occurs when a SANDWICH
comes between the earth and the SUN and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern BANANA.
