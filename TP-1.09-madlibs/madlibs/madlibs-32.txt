HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing MILKs and beautiful PANTHERs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in SANDWICH advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a BANANA camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
VIOLIN. Then you either hire professional PANTHERs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SUNs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 101 years.
