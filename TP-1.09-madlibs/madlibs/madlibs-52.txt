THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a SANDWICH, and it looked like a giant
PANTHER with a slit down its CAT. We went inside and
looked through a ZEUS and were able to see JIGSAWs in
the sky that were millions of SUNs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
ARMYs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting VIOLINs. An eclipse occurs when a MILK
comes between the earth and the JELLYFISH and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern WALNUTS.
