THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a SANDWICH, and it looked like a giant
VIOLIN with a slit down its MILK. We went inside and
looked through a ARMY and were able to see JIGSAWs in
the sky that were millions of WALNUTSs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
CATs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting BANANAs. An eclipse occurs when a JELLYFISH
comes between the earth and the PANTHER and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern SUN.
