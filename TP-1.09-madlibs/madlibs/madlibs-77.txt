HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing JELLYFISHs and beautiful BANANAs. They sell
the prints to CHUBBY magazines or to agencies who use
them in SANDWICH advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a CAT camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
SUN. Then you either hire professional BANANAs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JIGSAWs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 73 years.
