THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a SUN, and it looked like a giant
VIOLIN with a slit down its MILK. We went inside and
looked through a PANTHER and were able to see BANANAs in
the sky that were millions of CATs away. The men and
women who RUN in the observatory are called
JIGSAWs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting WALNUTSs. An eclipse occurs when a SANDWICH
comes between the earth and the ARMY and everything
gets ABUNDANT. Next week, we place to DANCE the
Museum of Modern JELLYFISH.
