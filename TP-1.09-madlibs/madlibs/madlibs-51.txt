ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking BANANA",
have enchanted both the young and old WALNUTSs for the last
0 years, Alice's STICKY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy MILK. There she discovers she
can become a tall JIGSAW or a small PANTHER simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ARMY. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice KICKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White SANDWICH, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire JELLYFISH, and even the Queen of ZEUSs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an CHUBBY
end when Alice awakens from her ZEUS.
