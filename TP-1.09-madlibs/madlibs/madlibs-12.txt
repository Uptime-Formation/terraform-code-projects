ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its GRUMPY sequel, "Through the Looking MILK",
have enchanted both the young and old CATs for the last
42 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy JELLYFISH. There she discovers she
can become a tall ARMY or a small JIGSAW simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic SUN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White BANANA, the BITTER Hatter,
the Cheshire ZEUS, and even the Queen of VIOLINs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an THUNDERING
end when Alice awakens from her VIOLIN.
