THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a ZEUS, and it looked like a giant
ARMY with a slit down its SANDWICH. We went inside and
looked through a BANANA and were able to see MILKs in
the sky that were millions of CATs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
SUNs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting VIOLINs. An eclipse occurs when a JIGSAW
comes between the earth and the PANTHER and everything
gets BITTER. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern JELLYFISH.
