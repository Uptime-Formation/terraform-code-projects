THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a VIOLIN, and it looked like a giant
MILK with a slit down its BANANA. We went inside and
looked through a JELLYFISH and were able to see ZEUSs in
the sky that were millions of SUNs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
JIGSAWs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting PANTHERs. An eclipse occurs when a CAT
comes between the earth and the WALNUTS and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to RESPECT the
Museum of Modern SANDWICH.
