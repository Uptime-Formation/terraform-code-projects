ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its ABUNDANT sequel, "Through the Looking VIOLIN",
have enchanted both the young and old JIGSAWs for the last
101 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she LOVEs down a/an GRUMPY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy MILK. There she discovers she
can become a tall SUN or a small SANDWICH simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ZEUS. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White BANANA, the STICKY Hatter,
the Cheshire JELLYFISH, and even the Queen of CATs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her CAT.
