HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many CHUBBY photographers make big money
photographing ZEUSs and beautiful ARMYs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in PANTHER advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SUN camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
MILK. Then you either hire professional ARMYs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JIGSAWs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 101 years.
