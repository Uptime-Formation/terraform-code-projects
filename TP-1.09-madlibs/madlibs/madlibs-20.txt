HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing SANDWICHs and beautiful VIOLINs. They sell
the prints to STICKY magazines or to agencies who use
them in SUN advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a JIGSAW camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
BANANA. Then you either hire professional VIOLINs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JELLYFISHs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 27 years.
