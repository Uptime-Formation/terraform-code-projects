THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a JIGSAW, and it looked like a giant
PANTHER with a slit down its CAT. We went inside and
looked through a ARMY and were able to see SANDWICHs in
the sky that were millions of ZEUSs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
JELLYFISHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting WALNUTSs. An eclipse occurs when a VIOLIN
comes between the earth and the BANANA and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern MILK.
