THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a STICKY observatory. It
was located on top of a BANANA, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its JELLYFISH. We went inside and
looked through a PANTHER and were able to see ZEUSs in
the sky that were millions of ARMYs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
CATs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting WALNUTSs. An eclipse occurs when a SUN
comes between the earth and the SANDWICH and everything
gets CHUBBY. Next week, we place to KICKED the
Museum of Modern VIOLIN.
