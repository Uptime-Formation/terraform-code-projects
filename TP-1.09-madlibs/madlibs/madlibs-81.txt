ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking ARMY",
have enchanted both the young and old WALNUTSs for the last
101 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she RUNs down a/an STICKY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy JIGSAW. There she discovers she
can become a tall VIOLIN or a small JELLYFISH simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic BANANA. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White CAT, the BITTER Hatter,
the Cheshire MILK, and even the Queen of SUNs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an GRUMPY
end when Alice awakens from her SUN.
