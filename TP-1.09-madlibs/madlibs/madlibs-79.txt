THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a WALNUTS, and it looked like a giant
JELLYFISH with a slit down its JIGSAW. We went inside and
looked through a BANANA and were able to see ZEUSs in
the sky that were millions of SANDWICHs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
MILKs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting SUNs. An eclipse occurs when a ARMY
comes between the earth and the CAT and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern PANTHER.
