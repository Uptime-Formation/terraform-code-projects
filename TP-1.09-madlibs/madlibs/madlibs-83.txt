HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing JIGSAWs and beautiful ARMYs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in BANANA advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SANDWICH camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
VIOLIN. Then you either hire professional ARMYs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary ZEUSs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 0 years.
