THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a PANTHER, and it looked like a giant
SUN with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a JELLYFISH and were able to see JIGSAWs in
the sky that were millions of VIOLINs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
MILKs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting BANANAs. An eclipse occurs when a ARMY
comes between the earth and the ZEUS and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to KICKED the
Museum of Modern CAT.
