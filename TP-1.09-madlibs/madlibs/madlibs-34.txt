THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a WALNUTS, and it looked like a giant
SANDWICH with a slit down its VIOLIN. We went inside and
looked through a JIGSAW and were able to see JELLYFISHs in
the sky that were millions of ARMYs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
ZEUSs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting BANANAs. An eclipse occurs when a SUN
comes between the earth and the PANTHER and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern MILK.
