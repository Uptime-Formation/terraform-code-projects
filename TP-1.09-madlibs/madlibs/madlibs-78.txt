ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its STICKY sequel, "Through the Looking SUN",

73 years, Alice's THUNDERING adventures begin
when she LOVEs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy CAT. There she discovers she
can become a tall BANANA or a small ARMY simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic VIOLIN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RESPECTs such remarkable
characters as the White WALNUTS, the ABUNDANT Hatter,
the Cheshire JIGSAW, and even the Queen of ZEUSs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her ZEUS.
