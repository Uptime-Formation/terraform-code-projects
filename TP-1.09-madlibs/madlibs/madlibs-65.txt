HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing SANDWICHs and beautiful CATs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in ARMY advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a MILK camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
PANTHER. Then you either hire professional CATs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JIGSAWs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 73 years.
