HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing JELLYFISHs and beautiful CATs. They sell
the prints to BITTER magazines or to agencies who use
them in BANANA advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SUN camera. You also need an
THUNDERING meter and filters and a special close-up
PANTHER. Then you either hire professional CATs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary VIOLINs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least -5 years.
