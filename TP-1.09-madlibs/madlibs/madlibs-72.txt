ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its GRUMPY sequel, "Through the Looking ZEUS",
have enchanted both the young and old JELLYFISHs for the last
0 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she RUNs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy WALNUTS. There she discovers she
can become a tall SANDWICH or a small CAT simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic SUN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White PANTHER, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire BANANA, and even the Queen of JIGSAWs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her JIGSAW.
