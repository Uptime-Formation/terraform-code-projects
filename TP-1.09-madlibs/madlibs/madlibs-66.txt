ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its THUNDERING sequel, "Through the Looking PANTHER",
have enchanted both the young and old JIGSAWs for the last
27 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy SUN. There she discovers she
can become a tall MILK or a small ZEUS simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic BANANA. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White JELLYFISH, the BITTER Hatter,
the Cheshire ARMY, and even the Queen of CATs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an GRUMPY
end when Alice awakens from her CAT.
