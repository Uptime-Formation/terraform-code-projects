HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing MILKs and beautiful BANANAs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in ARMY advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SUN camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
SANDWICH. Then you either hire professional BANANAs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary PANTHERs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 73 years.
