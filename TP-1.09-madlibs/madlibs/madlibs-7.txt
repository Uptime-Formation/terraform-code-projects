THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a THUNDERING observatory. It
was located on top of a VIOLIN, and it looked like a giant
PANTHER with a slit down its JELLYFISH. We went inside and
looked through a ZEUS and were able to see WALNUTSs in
the sky that were millions of BANANAs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
JIGSAWs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting SUNs. An eclipse occurs when a CAT
comes between the earth and the SANDWICH and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to KICKED the
Museum of Modern MILK.
