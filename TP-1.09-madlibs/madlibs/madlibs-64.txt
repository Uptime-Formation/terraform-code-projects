THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a ARMY, and it looked like a giant
SUN with a slit down its PANTHER. We went inside and
looked through a BANANA and were able to see ZEUSs in
the sky that were millions of WALNUTSs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
JELLYFISHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting JIGSAWs. An eclipse occurs when a SANDWICH
comes between the earth and the VIOLIN and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern MILK.
