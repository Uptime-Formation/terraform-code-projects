THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a JELLYFISH, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a ARMY and were able to see VIOLINs in
the sky that were millions of MILKs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
SANDWICHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting PANTHERs. An eclipse occurs when a ZEUS
comes between the earth and the BANANA and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to RUN the
Museum of Modern SUN.
