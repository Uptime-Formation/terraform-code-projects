73 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she DANCEs down a/an GRUMPY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy ZEUS. There she discovers she
can become a tall JIGSAW or a small VIOLIN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic JELLYFISH. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White WALNUTS, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire BANANA, and even the Queen of PANTHERs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
