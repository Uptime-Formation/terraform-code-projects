HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing WALNUTSs and beautiful CATs. They sell
the prints to ABUNDANT magazines or to agencies who use
them in ZEUS advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a BANANA camera. You also need an
THUNDERING meter and filters and a special close-up
SANDWICH. Then you either hire professional CATs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JELLYFISHs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 27 years.
