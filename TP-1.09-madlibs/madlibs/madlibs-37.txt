THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a GRUMPY observatory. It
was located on top of a ZEUS, and it looked like a giant
SANDWICH with a slit down its MILK. We went inside and
looked through a JIGSAW and were able to see VIOLINs in
the sky that were millions of WALNUTSs away. The men and
women who RESPECT in the observatory are called
CATs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting BANANAs. An eclipse occurs when a JELLYFISH
comes between the earth and the ARMY and everything
gets ABUNDANT. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern SUN.
