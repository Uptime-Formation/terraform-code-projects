ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its BITTER sequel, "Through the Looking CAT",
have enchanted both the young and old SANDWICHs for the last
101 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she RESPECTs down a/an STICKY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy BANANA. There she discovers she
can become a tall VIOLIN or a small WALNUTS simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic SUN. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RUNs such remarkable
characters as the White JELLYFISH, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire PANTHER, and even the Queen of ARMYs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an THUNDERING
end when Alice awakens from her ARMY.
