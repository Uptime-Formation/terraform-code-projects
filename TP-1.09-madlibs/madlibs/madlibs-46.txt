THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a BITTER observatory. It
was located on top of a CAT, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its JELLYFISH. We went inside and
looked through a SUN and were able to see SANDWICHs in
the sky that were millions of VIOLINs away. The men and
women who BAKED in the observatory are called
WALNUTSs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ZEUSs. An eclipse occurs when a BANANA
comes between the earth and the MILK and everything
gets STICKY. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern PANTHER.
