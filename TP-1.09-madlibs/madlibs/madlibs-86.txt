HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing PANTHERs and beautiful ARMYs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in MILK advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SUN camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
BANANA. Then you either hire professional ARMYs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary SANDWICHs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least -5 years.
