ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its GRUMPY sequel, "Through the Looking MILK",
have enchanted both the young and old VIOLINs for the last
-5 years, Alice's BITTER adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an STICKY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy BANANA. There she discovers she
can become a tall SUN or a small ARMY simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic JELLYFISH. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice DANCEs such remarkable
characters as the White JIGSAW, the CHUBBY Hatter,
the Cheshire SANDWICH, and even the Queen of ZEUSs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her ZEUS.
