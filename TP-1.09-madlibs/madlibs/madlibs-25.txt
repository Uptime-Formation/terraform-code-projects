THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a ABUNDANT observatory. It
was located on top of a CAT, and it looked like a giant
JIGSAW with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a BANANA and were able to see MILKs in
the sky that were millions of SANDWICHs away. The men and
women who DANCE in the observatory are called
PANTHERs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting ARMYs. An eclipse occurs when a SUN
comes between the earth and the VIOLIN and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to LOVE the
Museum of Modern ZEUS.
