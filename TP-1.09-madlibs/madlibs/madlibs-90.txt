ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its CHUBBY sequel, "Through the Looking BANANA",
have enchanted both the young and old CATs for the last
27 years, Alice's GRUMPY adventures begin
when she RUNs down a/an ABUNDANT hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy PANTHER. There she discovers she
can become a tall VIOLIN or a small MILK simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic WALNUTS. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice KICKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White SUN, the BITTER Hatter,
the Cheshire SANDWICH, and even the Queen of ARMYs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her ARMY.
