ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its BITTER sequel, "Through the Looking CAT",
have enchanted both the young and old SANDWICHs for the last
73 years, Alice's CHUBBY adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an STICKY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy JELLYFISH. There she discovers she
can become a tall SUN or a small WALNUTS simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic JIGSAW. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice DANCEs such remarkable
characters as the White MILK, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire ARMY, and even the Queen of PANTHERs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her PANTHER.
