THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a PANTHER, and it looked like a giant
ZEUS with a slit down its JELLYFISH. We went inside and
looked through a BANANA and were able to see JIGSAWs in
the sky that were millions of MILKs away. The men and
women who LOVE in the observatory are called
ARMYs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting VIOLINs. An eclipse occurs when a CAT
comes between the earth and the SANDWICH and everything
gets GRUMPY. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern WALNUTS.
