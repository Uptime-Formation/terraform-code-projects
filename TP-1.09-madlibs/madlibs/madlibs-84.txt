ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its STICKY sequel, "Through the Looking CAT",
have enchanted both the young and old WALNUTSs for the last
101 years, Alice's ABUNDANT adventures begin
when she RUNs down a/an GRUMPY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy SANDWICH. There she discovers she
can become a tall JIGSAW or a small SUN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic MILK. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice DANCEs such remarkable
characters as the White BANANA, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire JELLYFISH, and even the Queen of VIOLINs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an BITTER
end when Alice awakens from her VIOLIN.
