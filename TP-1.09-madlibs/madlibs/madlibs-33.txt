ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD

Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its STICKY sequel, "Through the Looking SANDWICH",
have enchanted both the young and old ZEUSs for the last
0 years, Alice's BITTER adventures begin
when she BAKEDs down a/an GRUMPY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy MILK. There she discovers she
can become a tall JELLYFISH or a small SUN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic ARMY. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White WALNUTS, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire VIOLIN, and even the Queen of BANANAs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her BANANA.
